Hello! :)

I am a Data Consultant in the Health and Biological Sciences. My passion for data science started during my PhD at the University of British Columbia where I used R programming to analyze genomic data to drive my research in epigenetics. I have worked with a variety of data types ranging from clinical data extracted from millions of electronic health records to RNA sequencing of case/control studies. I thoroughly enjoy learning about and exploring new clinically-related datasets to provide meaningful insights for improving patient care.
