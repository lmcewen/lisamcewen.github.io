Hi! 

I am Lisa, a Clinical Data Consultant currently working with the [Vancouver Island Health Authority](https://www.islandhealth.ca/). My roles involves analyzing clinical information extracted from electronic health records to inform decision making. I primarily use SQL to query a data warehouse and analyze/visualize the data in RStudio. I have also recently been appointed as a Adjunct Assistant Professor in [Health Information Science](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/). I am very much interested in using clinical data to provide meaningful insights that can contribute to better patient care. 

I obtained a PhD in Medical Genetics in the Faculty of Medicine at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (2018). During my degree, I acquired a significant interest in computational data analyses using R/RStudio. 

## Research Interests:
* Health Data Analytics
* Data Mining and Machine Learning in Health Care
* Decision Support Tools 
* Electronic Health Records
* Biomarkers of Aging and Disease
