Hello! :)

I am a Clinical Data Consultant currently working with the [Vancouver Island Health Authority](https://www.islandhealth.ca/). My role involves analyzing clinical information extracted from electronic health records to inform decision making. I primarily use SQL to query a data warehouse, and analyze/visualize the data in RStudio. I am a passionate R-user and teacher, fascinated by the endless options available in R for working with data from basic manipulations to elaborate dynamic visualizations with ShinyApps! Recently, I have  been appointed as an Adjunct Assistant Professor in [Health Information Science](https://www.uvic.ca/hsd/hinf/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/). I am very much interested in using clinical data to provide meaningful insights that can contribute to better patient care.  

## Research Interests:
* Health Data Analytics
* Data Mining and Machine Learning in Health Care
* Decision Support Tools 
* Electronic Health Records
* Biomarkers of Aging and Disease
